# Scrapping-Deezer-Music
My goal here is to be able to scrape all my Deezer music in order to have it in a DataFrame or in an excel file. This allows me to search for music in my playlist more easily.
For example a music that has 3 letters but I don't remember the name. So with a DataFrame you can easily display all the music with 3 letters !
